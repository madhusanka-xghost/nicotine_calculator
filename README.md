## 🧠 Overview

The **Smoking Habits Analyzer** is a simple CLI-based C application that lets users input their smoking habits (Beedi, Cigarettes, or Both) and then calculates:

- 💨 Estimated nicotine intake per day  
- 💰 Total cost per day, week, and year  
- 📅 Lifetime smoking count based on years  
- ⚠️ A friendly, humorous message encouraging awareness  


This is for entertainment purposes only, not for medical use or serious analysis.
Stay healthy, code hard, and maybe help a friend quit smoking 💪🚭
